The code has 5 functions : 
  1. `main` : main function called when binary is executed.
  1. `jacky_tunning_banniere` : do nothing but showing a *cool* banner at binary launch.
  1. `uncipher_file` : will uncipher a file with the `secret_key` (hardcoded :p).
  1. `est_ce_une_bonne_cle` : check whether or not the key is correct. 
  1. `regex_match` : function to use regex (*totally not taken online*).

Binary has some options available, but not given that *easily* (**strings**).

If you want to reverse the binary, the function `est_ce_une_bonne_cle` is what will be the most interesting.
